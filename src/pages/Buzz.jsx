      <h1>To Infinity… and Beyond</h1>

      <p>
        You’ve discovered a hidden easter egg.
        At Suhaffinity, curiosity isn’t accidental — it’s intentional.
      </p>

      <p>
        Just like Buzz Lightyear, we believe progress comes from pushing
        past perceived limits, exploring the unknown, and aiming higher
        than what feels safe or obvious.
      </p>

      <p>
        “In infinitum et ultra” isn’t just a slogan.
        It’s a mindset — one that drives how we think, build, and evolve.
